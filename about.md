# 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Komiljon**, an AI developer with a strong passion for creating intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

With a focus on **deep learning**, **speech processing**, and **computer vision**, I design and develop applications that range from real-time voice classification to face tracking and animation.

## 🎓 Background

I hold a Master's degree and have several years of professional experience working on AI-powered systems, particularly in:

- **Voice classification & anti-spoofing**
- **Text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT)**
- **Face detection, segmentation, and animation**
- **Model optimization for deployment (TFLite, ONNX, TensorRT)**

Currently, I’m working at **Museblossome** as an AI Developer, where I develop robust, efficient, and scalable AI solutions.
